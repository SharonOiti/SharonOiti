<!-- my coding journey -->
## Sharon's Coding Journey 🌟💻
My coding journey began at North Seattle College, fueled by my passion for technology and problem-solving 💻. From the moment I stepped into my first programming class, I felt a spark. The thrill of creating something from scratch and the joy of debugging a tricky piece of code ignited my love for coding. However, as the coursework became more demanding, I started to feel overwhelmed 😰. I realized it was time to take a step back and reassess my path. During this break, I faced my fears head-on 🌈. I explored new interests and gained valuable life experiences that helped me grow both personally and professionally. This period of reflection taught me resilience and adaptability—skills that are essential in the ever-evolving tech world. I learned that taking a break wasn’t a failure; it was a chance to recharge and refocus my energy ⚡. Now, I’m fully immersed in a Software Engineering Bootcamp, excited to hone my skills and tackle the challenges that come my way 🚀. Each day is a new adventure filled with lessons, and I’m constantly amazed at how much I can learn in such a short time 📚. From mastering languages like JavaScript and Python to diving into various frameworks and tools, I’m equipping myself with the knowledge needed to thrive in the tech industry. As I take on coding challenges, I’m also conquering new fears, and building confidence with every project I complete 🎉. Collaborating with my peers has been incredibly rewarding, as we share insights and support each other through the ups and downs of this journey. I’ve discovered that community is vital, and I’m grateful for the connections I’m making along the way 🤝.
This journey has taught me that overcoming fear is just the first step toward achieving my dreams 🌟. I’m excited to create impactful projects that can genuinely make a difference in people’s lives 🌍. With each line of code, I feel more empowered to contribute to the tech world, and I can’t wait to see where this journey takes me next! 🚀💖
